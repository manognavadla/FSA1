package Day17;
/*
 * You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
-> 0 representing an empty cell,
-> 1 representing a fresh orange, or
-> 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. 
If this is impossible, return -1.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: Two integers, m and n, represents grid[] sizes
Line-2 to m: n Space separated integers, represents grid[i][j]

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: An integer

Sample Input-1:
---------------
3 3
2 1 1
1 1 0
0 1 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
4

Sample Input-2:
---------------
3 3
2 1 1
0 1 1
1 0 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
-1

Explanation: 
-------------
The orange in the bottom left corner (row 2, column 0) is never rotten, 
because rotting only happens 4-directionally.

Sample Input-3:
---------------
1 1
0 2

Sample Output-3:
----------------
0

Explanation: Since there are already no fresh oranges at minute 0, the answer is just 0.
 
Constraints:
------------
m == grid.length
n == grid[i].length
1 <= m, n <= 10
grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.
