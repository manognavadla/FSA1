package Day7;
/*
 * You are given an array nums of size n, where each element represents an object colored red, white, or blue. 
Your task is to sort the array in-place so that all objects of the same color are adjacent, following the order:
-> Red (0)
-> White (1)
-> Blue (2)

Rules:
-> You must not use the built-in sort function.
-> You must modify the array in-place with a time-efficient approach.

Input Format:
-------------
Line 1: An integer n, representing the size of the array.
Line 2: n space-separated integers representing the array nums, where each element is either 0 (red), 1 (white), or 2 (blue).

Output Format:
--------------
Line-1: Print the sorted array as n space-separated integers.

Constraints:
------------
-> 1≤n≤300
-> nums[i]∈{0,1,2} (each element is either 0, 1, or 2)

Sample Input-1:
---------------
6
2 0 2 1 1 0

Sample Output-1:
----------------
0 0 1 1 2 2

Sample Input-2:
---------------
3
2 0 1

Sample Output-2:
----------------
0 1 2
