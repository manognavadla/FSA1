/*
 * Imagine you're an archivist in the ancient Kingdom of Numeria, tasked with 
recording the royal lineage on a sacred scroll. Every monarch is identified 
by a unique number, and the family tree unfolds in a very specific way. 
Your mission is to transcribe this dynasty using a method that adheres 
to the following customs:

Royal Inscription:  
- Each monarch’s unique number is written as their signature on the scroll.

Enclosing Descendants:  
- If a monarch has offspring, their descendants must be recorded inside parentheses 
  immediately following the monarch’s number.
    - The first-born (or primary heir) is enclosed in its own set of parentheses.
    - If there is a second-born, their number is similarly enclosed, following 
      the first-born’s parentheses.

Omitting Redundant Markings:  
- Empty pairs of parentheses are generally left off the scroll to keep the record neat.
- However, if a monarch has a second-born but first-born is no more, you must include 
  an empty pair of parentheses to clearly mark the absence of a primary heir—ensuring 
  the lineage is accurately mapped.

Your task is to create such an inscription that perfectly reflects the 
hierarchical structure of the royal lineage.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
1 2 3 4

Sample Output-1:
----------------
1(2(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /    
    4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler. He has two heirs: Monarch 2 (first-born) and 
  Monarch 3 (second-born).
- Monarch 2 has a single descendant, Monarch 4, recorded as his first-born.
- Since empty markings for non-existent descendants are omitted (because they 
  don't add any information), the inscription is kept concise.
- Thus, the final transcription on the sacred scroll is: "1(2(4))(3)"

Sample Input-2:
---------------
1 2 3 -1 4

Sample Output-2:
----------------
1(2()(4))(3)

Explanation:
        1
       / \
      2   3
       \
        4

- Monarch 1 is the founding ruler with two heirs: Monarch 2 and Monarch 3.
- In this dynasty, Monarch 2 first-born is no more alive but does have a younger 
  descendant, Monarch 4.
- To ensure the record accurately reflects the gap in succession for Monarch 2, 
  an empty pair of parentheses is added before representing Monarch 4. 
  This explicitly marks the absence of a first-born heir.
- Therefore, the recorded inscription becomes: "1(2()(4))(3)"

Sample Input-3:
---------------
1 2 3 4 -1 5 6 -1 7

Sample Output-3:
---------------
1(2(4()(7)))(3(5)(6))
